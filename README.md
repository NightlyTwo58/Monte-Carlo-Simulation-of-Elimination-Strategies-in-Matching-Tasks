# Monte Carlo Estimation of Accuracy Gains from Option and Pair Elimination in Matching Tasks:<br>
**Abstract**<br>
Matching word problems are common in tests and many test-taking strategies have been developed, both explicitly and implicitly, to improve chances of correctly answering them. Unlike other variations of multiple-choice questions, matching word questions are rather difficult to guess correctly. Matching word problems usually consist of multiple terms on the left, and multiple definitions or answers on the right, usually unordered. The test-taker's goal is to match them one-to-one correctly.<br>
In this exploration, we seek to measure the gains in accuracy from two common strategies in matching word problems: eliminating possible matches for a given term and specific pairings. Both are simulated based on the additional premise that the removal is always of an incorrect term or pairing, as test-takers sometimes eliminate the correct option.<br>
